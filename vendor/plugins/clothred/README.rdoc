= ClothRed HTML 2 Textile converter

== What it is

A library to convert HTML into Textile markup for use, for example, with 
RedCloth.


== Requirements

All you need is Ruby.

== Get it

Available as a gem on RubyForge:
gem install ClothRed

Or download from RubyForge:
http://rubyforge.org/frs/?group_id=3427

Or get the source:
svn checkout svn://viewvc.rubyforge.mmmultiworks.com/var/svn/clothred

== Bugfixes
Documentation is now generated on install time by RubyGems.



== Features

This is alpha software, and only a few Textile rules have been 
implemented yet:
 * font markup and weight (<b>, <strong>, ...)
 * text formatting (<sub>, <sup>, <ins>,<del>)
 * Support for headings
 * Support for paragraphs and <blockquote>
 * Support for Textile entities
 * HTML is being escaped into UTF-8 via Ruby's CGI Library. This is the very last step in the process.

== Usage

require 'clothred'

text = ClothRed.new("<b>Bold</b> <em>HTML</em>!")
text.to_textile
